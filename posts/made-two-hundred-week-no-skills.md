# How I Made Two Hundred Bucks in a Week Without Skills

Let me tell you about the week that changed everything.

It was a Tuesday in December. My car needed a $400 repair, my Christmas budget was already stretched thin, and my savings account showed a disappointing $127. I needed money—fast—but I had no special skills, no side business, and definitely no time for a second job.

Seven days later, I had $217.43 in extra earnings. Here's exactly how I did it, hour by hour, dollar by dollar.

## Day 1: The Setup (Tuesday)

**Time invested: 2 hours | Earnings: $0**

I know what you're thinking—no earnings on day one? But this is the day that made everything else possible. I treated it like planting seeds.

### Morning (45 minutes)

I signed up for four platforms while drinking my coffee:

1. **Prolific** - Academic research studies, $8-12/hour equivalent
2. **UserTesting** - App and website testing, $10-60 per test
3. **Swagbucks** - Survey aggregator with bonuses
4. **Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)** - Microtasks

For each platform, I filled out every profile question completely. This is crucial—companies filter participants based on demographics. The more complete your profile, the more opportunities you unlock.

### Afternoon (45 minutes)

I downloaded the Prolific extension for Chrome and the Swagbucks app on my phone. I also bookmarked MTurk and set up payment through PayPal.

### Evening (30 minutes)

I took three qualification tests on UserTesting. You record yourself navigating a sample website while speaking your thoughts aloud. Two passed, one failed. That's normal.

**Day 1 Total: $0.00**

---

## Day 2: First Dollars (Wednesday)

**Time invested: 3 hours | Earnings: $34.50**

### 9:00 AM - The First Check

I checked Prolific first thing. Three studies were available! I grabbed all of them:

- "Social Media Usage Survey" - 8 minutes - $1.50
- "Product Preference Study" - 15 minutes - $2.80
- "AI Ethics Research" - 20 minutes - $4.00

**Subtotal: $8.30 in 43 minutes**

### 12:30 PM - Lunch Break Hustle

At lunch, I refreshed UserTesting and found my first real test: a mobile banking app review. I spent 15 minutes exploring the app, talking through my thoughts, and answering follow-up questions.

**Payment: $10.00**

### 7:00 PM - Evening Session

After dinner, I dedicated 90 minutes to grinding:

- MTurk batch tasks (categorizing product images): 45 minutes → $6.20
- UserTesting screener + full test: 30 minutes → $10.00
- Swagbucks video watching while doing other tasks: Passive → $0.00 (banked points)

**Day 2 Total: $34.50**

I couldn't believe it. In less than three hours of actual work, I'd earned more than I used to make in half a day at my old retail job. But I knew I couldn't rest—the goal was $200.

## Day 3: Finding My Rhythm (Thursday)

**Time invested: 2.5 hours | Earnings: $28.75**

### The Morning Check Ritual

I established a pattern: check Prolific at 9 AM, 12 PM, and 6 PM. Most studies drop during business hours EST.

Morning Prolific haul:
- "Memory and Cognition Study" - 25 minutes - $5.00
- "Purchasing Decisions Survey" - 10 minutes - $1.75

**Subtotal: $6.75**

### Afternoon Discovery

I found something on MTurk called "batch HITs"—tasks that take 30-60 seconds each but you can do hundreds of them. I found a batch for labeling whether photos contained animals or not.

**150 tasks × $0.04 = $6.00 in 50 minutes**

Not glamorous, but it added up. I put on a podcast and powered through.

### Evening Gold

UserTesting came through again with a premium test—a 45-minute moderated session with a researcher from a major e-commerce company. We had a video call where they watched me shop on their website and asked questions in real-time.

**Payment: $60.00** (delivered in 7 days, but I'm counting it)

Wait, that's $60 for 45 minutes of work? Yes. Moderated tests pay significantly more, and they're also more engaging. You're having a conversation, not just talking to yourself.

**Day 3 Total: $28.75** (not counting the pending $60)

## Day 4: The Slow Day (Friday)

**Time invested: 1.5 hours | Earnings: $18.20**

Every side hustle has slow days. Friday was mine. Fewer studies on Prolific, fewer tests on UserTesting. But I didn't let that stop me.

### Pivoting Strategy

When the main platforms are slow, you have to diversify. I signed up for two additional platforms:

- **dscout** - In-depth research studies, pays $25-250
- **Respondent** - B2B research, pays $50-400 per study

These take longer to qualify for but pay significantly more.

### What I Actually Earned

- Prolific studies: $7.20
- MTurk batch tasks: $5.00
- Swagbucks survey (finally!): $6.00

**Day 4 Total: $18.20**

I was at $81.45 after four days. Halfway there? Not quite. But I had the weekend ahead.

## Day 5: Weekend Warrior (Saturday)

**Time invested: 4 hours | Earnings: $52.30**

Weekends are interesting for side hustles. Fewer corporate surveys, but more time to dedicate. I decided to block out the morning for focused grinding.

### 8:00 AM - 12:00 PM: The Marathon

I made it a game. Every task completed, I tracked in a spreadsheet. Here's what four hours looked like:

| Platform | Tasks | Time | Earnings |
|----------|-------|------|----------|
| Prolific | 4 studies | 55 min | $12.50 |
| UserTesting | 2 tests | 35 min | $20.00 |
| MTurk | Batch + individual | 90 min | $14.80 |
| Swagbucks | Surveys + bonuses | 60 min | $5.00 |

**Morning Total: $52.30**

### The Breakthrough Moment

Around 11 AM, I got an email from dscout. They wanted me for a week-long study about my morning routine. I'd have to record short videos each day about how I start my day.

**Payment: $75.00** (to be paid after completion)

I accepted immediately. This is the power of signing up for everything—opportunities find you.

**Day 5 Total: $52.30** (plus $75 pending)

## Day 6: Sunday Surprise (Sunday)

**Time invested: 2 hours | Earnings: $31.00**

Sundays are typically the slowest day for surveys and tests. But I'd learned something important: the platforms reward consistency.

### Morning Check

Prolific had a study specifically looking for participants who log in on weekends. They were researching "weekend leisure activities." 

**Payment: $8.00 for 20 minutes**

### Afternoon Windfall

UserTesting sent a push notification—a "Live Conversation" was available. These are premium moderated sessions that fill up in seconds. I grabbed it.

The session was with a startup building a meal planning app. We talked for 30 minutes about my cooking habits, frustrations with meal prep, and what features would make me switch apps.

**Payment: $23.00**

I also cashed out my Swagbucks points. I'd accumulated 2,500 points (worth $25) but I'd only count what I earned this week: roughly $8 worth.

**Day 6 Total: $31.00**

---

## Day 7: The Final Push (Monday)

**Time invested: 3 hours | Earnings: $52.48**

I woke up with $163.75 confirmed earnings. I needed $36.25 more to hit my goal. Monday was make-or-break.

### 8:00 AM - Aggressive Refresh Mode

I had browser tabs open for Prolific, UserTesting, and MTurk. I refreshed every few minutes while doing morning tasks.

By 10 AM:
- 2 Prolific studies: $6.50
- 1 UserTesting test: $10.00

**Running total: $180.25**

### Noon - The Bonus Hunt

Swagbucks and other platforms often have bonuses for completing specific tasks. I found:

- "Complete 5 surveys today" bonus: $5.00
- Sign up for a free trial (I set a reminder to cancel): $8.00
- Watch video series: $1.50

**Running total: $194.75**

### 4:00 PM - The Final Tasks

I needed $5.25 more. I went to MTurk and found a batch task that paid well: transcribing short audio clips.

**42 clips × $0.13 = $5.46**

Took about an hour, but it got me over the line.

**Day 7 Total: $52.48**

## The Final Count

| Day | Time Spent | Earnings |
|-----|------------|----------|
| Tuesday | 2 hours | $0.00 |
| Wednesday | 3 hours | $34.50 |
| Thursday | 2.5 hours | $28.75 |
| Friday | 1.5 hours | $18.20 |
| Saturday | 4 hours | $52.30 |
| Sunday | 2 hours | $31.00 |
| Monday | 3 hours | $52.48 |
| **TOTAL** | **18 hours** | **$217.23** |

Plus I had **$135 in pending payments** from the moderated sessions and dscout study.

**Effective hourly rate: $12.07/hour** (not counting pending payments)

With pending: **$19.57/hour**

## What I Learned

### 1. The First Week Is the Hardest

You're building reputation, learning the platforms, and figuring out what works. Week two and beyond will be more efficient.

### 2. Diversification Is Key

No single platform would have gotten me to $200. The combination of Prolific, UserTesting, MTurk, and Swagbucks created multiple income streams.

### 3. Premium Opportunities Exist

Moderated sessions and in-depth studies pay 3-5x more than standard surveys. Invest time in qualifying for them.

### 4. Consistency Beats Intensity

Checking platforms 3-4 times daily for 15 minutes beats one 4-hour grinding session. Opportunities come and go quickly.

### 5. Track Everything

My spreadsheet kept me motivated. Seeing the numbers grow, even by a few dollars, made me want to keep going.

## The Bigger Picture

That $217 paid for half my car repair. More importantly, it proved something to myself: extra income isn't reserved for people with special skills or lucky breaks. It's available to anyone willing to put in consistent effort.

Three months later, I'm averaging **$400-500/month** from these same platforms, spending about 8-10 hours per week. It's not life-changing money, but it covers groceries, pays down debt, and gives me breathing room.

And it all started with one week of focused effort.

**What's stopping you from starting today?**
